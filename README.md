A regression analysis performed on shot log data from the 2014-2015 NBA season

## Overview
This was a small project I completed when taking Linear Regression during the Spring Semester of my Sophomore year at Miami University. Although there is only one code file, I encourage you, the reader of this, to download and read through `report.docx`. `project1.R` is where I did all my computations and data analysis. `report.docx` is the final product of my analysis.
